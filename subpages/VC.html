<p><center><h2>Switzerland - The Swiss Guard</h2></center></p>
	<center><img src="Switzerland.png" alt="flag" height="100" width="180"></center>
 <p><strong>Use condotierri to sponsor a war in which France eliminates an Italian player.  Switzerland may not ally France.</strong></p>
<p>Switzerland is famous for our unique halberd-centric mercenaries.  Derivative of this, we have managed to become even more embroiled in Italian politics <em>than the Italians themselves.</em>  The French realize our superior military tactics and consistently employ us to facilitate their easterly ambitions.  We’re not sure whether it is their coin or their diplomats’ opinions on the Swiss that have advanced our position in the empire…but this is no time to change our method.</p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Naples - Support Skanderbeg</h2></center></p>
<center><img src="Naples.png" alt="flag" height="100" width="180"></center>
 <p><strong>Share great-power status with a sovereign Albania.</strong></p>
<p>Having wrested the throne from the Angevin monarchs, Alfonso V has secured the Kingdom of Naples for his illegitimate son Ferdinand.  Before dying in 1458, he attempted to protect Albania via vassalage; he owed a debt for their aid during his own invasion and was inspired by their string of victories against the waxing Turkish threat.  <em>If we are to maintain our position of power we must not shirk from our opportunities to assert it.</em></p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Milan - Patron Saint Ambrose</h2></center></p>
<center><img src="Milan.png" alt="flag" height="100" width="180"></center>
 <p><strong>The religious war has concluded and there are no Protestant (including Reformed) nations with the Latin culture group.</strong></p>
<p>Milan embraces Saint Ambrose as its patron Saint.  In times of strength we go as far as to consecrate our Republican tradition in his memory.  A stalwart defender of Roman Catholic tradition, Ambrose was beleaguered by heretical doctrines spreading during his era.  It is obvious how Saint Ambrose would act when faced with the <strong>plague</strong> that is Protestantism, and we are compelled to act in accordance with his wishes.</p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Savoy - Break the French Yoke</h2></center></p>
<center><img src="Savoy.png" alt="flag" height="100" width="180"></center>
 <p><strong>Exceed the development of France.</strong></p>
<p>Savoy has long been sovereign, yet the courtiers of Europe rarely acknowledge the Duke of Savoy as much more than a steward who prepares the earth it rests on for France’s inevitable occupation.  If France were to be weakened substantially we could finally forge a destiny <em>of our own.</em></p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Tunis - Axe to Grind</h2></center></p>
<center><img src="Tunis.png" alt="flag" height="100" width="180"></center>
 <p><strong>Simultaneously own the entire island of Sicily and the province of Rome.</strong></p>
<p>Tunis, the geographic successor state to Ancient Carthage, is overdue for retribution against the remnants of ancient Rome.  Time has eroded the customs and creeds of our ancestors – conjuring new mutual causes for strife.  There is bound to be a sadistic pleasure in realizing Hannibal’s ambitions, <em>even if our counterblow comes a thousand years too late.</em></p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Florence - Chancellor Niccolo Machiavelli</h2></center></p>
<center><img src="Florence.png" alt="flag" height="100" width="180"></center>
 <p><strong>Unite enough Italian states to create the Kingdom of Italy.</strong></p>
<p>Our diplomats are singing new songs following the unexpected appointment of a previously <em>exiled</em> man as Chancellor…</p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Genoa - Barbary Crusade</h2></center></p>
<center><img src="Genoa.png" alt="flag" height="100" width="180"></center>
 <p><strong>Own all coastal provinces in the Mediterranean Sea with Tunisian cores on them.</strong></p>
<p>Genoa has long aspired to the greatness of Venice.  We compete for Mediterranean trade-posts, maintain fleets of galleys to rival Venice’s naval prowess, and we even mimic the Venetian brand of Republican government.  How better to overshadow our rival than to do what they have not?  Purging Tunis from the map will strengthen us physically, but more importantly…<em>in the eyes of our peers.</em></p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Navarra - A Necessary Adaptation</h2></center></p>
<center><img src="Navarra.png" alt="flag" height="100" width="180"></center>
 <p><strong>Control eight trade-cities in Mediterranean trade-zones.  Each trade-city must have existed for at least ten years.</strong></p>
<p>Navarra is the last bastion of the Basque culture.  Kept under lock-and-key by the neighboring juggernauts that curtail any hope of our expansion, we have precious little time to make a pivotal, political venture.  If we are willing to set aside our pride as monarchs, we are in the perfect position for colonial and trade enterprise which won't require much expansion.  Perhaps our trade-prince rivals have grown complacent during our incarceration?</p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Bavaria - Rekindling the Empire</h2></center></p>
<center><img src="Bavaria.png" alt="flag" height="100" width="180"></center>
 <p><strong>Be the reigning Holy Roman Emperor while all nations with capital cities in the Italian region that are north of Rome are also members of the Holy Roman Empire (post 1490) or prevent the Shadow Kingdoms event (ante 1490).</strong></p>
<p>The liberal policy that the Austrian Emperor has proposed thus far regarding the treason in Italy can be summated as a blatant <em>lack</em> of action.  Favoring his dangerous obsession on foreign policy, our combined Imperial strength is eroding beneath us.  Though we are biased, we are not alone in contemplating the unified stength that would be obtained beneath a Bavarian emperor; many electorates are ready to cast their votes for us, on the condition we use the power to reign Italy back into the Empire.</p>
<hr>

<p><center><h2>Venice - Venetian Opportunism</h2></center></p>
<center><img src="Venice.png" alt="flag" height="100" width="180"></center>
 <p><strong>If no other player has achieved their goal by the end of the timeline, then all were undoubtedly thwarted by the machinations of the mischievous Venetian player.  <em>Therefore, Venice wins.</em></strong></p>
<p>Only Venetian cunning could keep a Republic so well preserved in such an age of barbarous monarchism.  Founded in 431 A.D. – we’ve borne witness to the fall of western Rome, we’ve outlasted our republican peers in Pisa and Amalfi, and we’ve even enlisted <strong>crusaders</strong> as mercenaries to maintain our interests.  <em>Despite contributing to the collapse of eastern Rome</em> – we ensure our presence in their final hour.  We’ll usher the French into Milan when it suits us and we’ll resume our Papal servitude when it doesn’t.  The blatant, clumsy emulation displayed by the Genoese flirts with a certain flattery that only encourages our behavior.</p>
